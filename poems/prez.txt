Hello! I'm Jérôme Martin.
I love programming, but I also love art and poetry.

So I made a poem-oriented language!










You write a poem, and you hide a program inside it by using specific words.
When the poem is read by the machine, it executes the program.








But I needed a virtual machine to execute my program in, so I settled on something simple and minimalist, yet powerful enough to make things interesting.


But first, I need to make a quick demographic census in the room...







    Who in the room was born in or before the 70s?
    Raise your hand!









    Who in the room is ready to
    go back to the 70s right now?











If you were born at that time, you might know about:

    The CHIP-8 virtual machine

It was created in the 70s as a simple way to write programs directly in hexadecimal.

It featured a way to show graphics on the screen, and was designed to ease the creation of games.

Let's go back in time and see what it looked like to program games in the 70s!
















If you liked the idea, and want to try by yourself:

    Go to      ->     rilouw.eu/poem      <-

    Read the docs by clicking "Help & Dictionary"

    Share your poems on Mastodon with the hashtag:

                    ->       #codepoetry       <-



    Thanks for your attention!
